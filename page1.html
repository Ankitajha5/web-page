	<h2><u><li>ART:</li></u></h2>
	<p><div align="left";><b>Art encompasses a wide variety of human endeavours involving artistic creativity.It is usually inferred as any action performed by a person with a communicative or artistic purpose something that expresses a concept, feeling, viewpoint of looking at the world, or, more broadly, a world view.Its blueprint contains a piece of culture, tradition, and a representation of economic and social surface. In general, we are unable to agree on a description of what constitutes true art, and our perceptions of art change over time. Painting, sculpture, and architecture are the three classical branches of visual art.</b></div></p>
<h2><u><li>ARTIST:</li></u></h2>
<p><div align="left";><b>An artist is a person who creates art with the help of their creative abilities and ideas. Without an artist, the world will be like a tree without leaves, flowers, or fruits. Artists use their creative medium of art work to communicate their thoughts and feelings about a variety of topics, such as the current situation, the beauty of nature, society, etc., history, their perspective on the world, and so on.Throughout history, the importance of art and artists has remained constant. Artists play an important role in preserving our culture, heritage, language, and skills, as well as passing on knowledge from one generation to the next.</b></div></p>

	" The aim of art
	   is not to
	 represent the
	outward appearance
	   of things,
	   but their
	inward significance."

	              By Aristotle

<h1><u><li>ART AND THE ARTIST:</li></u></h1>
<p><b>An artist is a person who is involved in the creation of art, the practise of art, or the demonstration of art. In both daily speech and scholarly debate, the term applies solely to a visual arts practitioner.Art appears to be nothing more than a direct visual representation of the artist's life. As a result, it's reasonable to believe that an artist's life experiences and values have a significant impact on their work. We can see the link between the artist and the art by looking at examples from various periods of art. It appears that the artwork will reveal a great deal about the artist.</b></p>
